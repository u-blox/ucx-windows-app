# ucx-windows-app - Windows Console Application for u-connectXpress

## Overview

A comprehensive Windows application for testing and configuring u-connectXpress devices (NORA-W36, NORA-B26). Built with native C code for optimal performance, stability, and ease of debugging.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Native C Implementation** - Direct API calls without wrapper layers
- ✅ **Professional Interface** - Dual menu modes (detailed/compact)
- ✅ **Secure Firmware Updates** - SHA256 verification with XMODEM protocol
- ✅ **Easy Deployment** - Launch script handles building and dependencies
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Code signing support for distribution

**Note:** HID over GATT (HoG) keyboard functionality is experimental and may not work reliably with all devices.

## Prerequisites for a Clean PC

To build and run this application from a fresh clone, you need:

### System Requirements
- **Windows 10 or Windows 11** (64-bit)
- Windows 7/8/8.1 may work but are not tested
- 32-bit Windows is not supported (requires 64-bit FTDI DLL)

### Required Software
1. **Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools** (or full Visual Studio 2022)
   - ✅ **Build Tools only** (minimal, ~2-3 GB): Includes MSVC compiler without IDE
     - Download: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe
     - During install, select "Desktop development with C++"
   - ✅ **Full Visual Studio 2022** (complete IDE, ~10-20 GB): If you want the IDE
     - Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
     - Install the "Desktop development with C++" workload
   - Both include MSVC compiler and Windows SDK
   - **Visual Studio 2019 also works** (use Build Tools or full IDE)

2. **CMake 3.15 or later**
   - CMake generates the Visual Studio project files
   - Download: https://cmake.org/download/
   - Use the Windows x64 Installer
   - ✅ During install, select "Add CMake to system PATH"

3. **Git** (for cloning)
   - Download: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Required for cloning the repository with submodules

### Hardware
- **FTDI USB device** (NORA-W36 or NORA-B26 module)
- FTDI drivers are embedded in the executable (auto-extracted to temp folder)

### Quick Setup Steps
```powershell
# 1. Clone the repository with submodule (non-recursive to skip STM32 dependencies)
git clone --recurse-submodules=ucxclient https://github.com/u-blox/ucx-windows-app.git
cd ucx-windows-app

# If you already cloned without submodules, initialize the submodule:
# git submodule update --init
# Or use the built-in launcher command:
# .\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd update
# Note: We don't use --recursive to avoid cloning the large STM32CubeF4 submodule (not needed for Windows)

# 2. Launch (auto-builds on first run)
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd

# That's it! The script handles CMake configuration and building.
```

### What the Launch Script Does
- Detects if CMake is configured (runs `cmake -S examples/ucx-windows-app -B build` if needed)
- Builds the executable if missing or outdated (source newer than exe)
- Embeds FTDI DLL into the executable as a resource (auto-extracted at runtime)
- Creates settings file (`ucx-windows-app.ini`) in project root if missing
- Smart version selection: Runs signed version if newer than unsigned
- Launches the application (ucx-windows-app.exe or ucx-windows-app-signed.exe)
- Can code-sign executables with certificate thumbprint for distribution
- Can build all configurations at once with the `all` command

### Launch Script Commands
```powershell
# Default: Auto-select signed if newer, else unsigned
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd

# Debug build
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd debug

# Force signed version
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd signed

# Build all configurations (Debug + Release)
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd all

# Update ucxclient submodule to latest version
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd update

# Clean build artifacts
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd clean [debug|release]

# Rebuild from scratch
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd rebuild [debug|release]

# Code sign the Release build
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd sign YOUR_CERT_THUMBPRINT

# Run comprehensive workspace tests
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd selftest
```

### Code Signing (Optional)
For production releases, you can digitally sign the executable:

```powershell
# Find your certificate thumbprint
# 1. Open Certificate Manager: certmgr.msc
# 2. Personal > Certificates > Your code signing cert > Details > Thumbprint
# 3. Copy the thumbprint (remove spaces)

# Sign Release build (creates ucx-windows-app-signed.exe in release/ folder)
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd sign YOUR_CERT_THUMBPRINT_HERE

# Example
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd sign EF3FD135F1CD669E0D7F4F...
```

**Output Location:**
- Signed executable: `ucx-windows-app/release/ucx-windows-app-signed.exe`
- Unsigned build: `ucx-windows-app/bin/ucx-windows-app.exe`
- The launcher auto-selects the signed version if it's newer

**Requirements for signing:**
- Windows SDK 10 (for signtool.exe)
- Code signing certificate (USB token or machine certificate store)
- SafeNet Authentication Client (if using USB token)

### Automatic Checks
The launch script automatically verifies:
- ✅ Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- ✅ CMake installed and in PATH
- ✅ Visual Studio with C++ tools installed

### Workspace Validation
Run a comprehensive selftest to verify workspace integrity:
```powershell
.\launch-ucx-windows-app.cmd selftest
```

This checks:
- ✅ Directory structure (src, inc, ucx_api, examples, build)
- ✅ Critical source files
- ✅ UCX API generated headers
- ✅ CMake configuration
- ✅ Build artifacts and executables
- ✅ Version information (-v flag)
- ✅ Git repository status

Use selftest before releases or after cloning to ensure everything is ready.

### Troubleshooting
If you get errors:
- **"64-bit Windows required"** → This app requires 64-bit Windows (uses 64-bit FTDI DLL)
- **"Windows 10 or 11 recommended"** → Older Windows versions may have issues
- **"cmake not found"** → Install CMake and add to PATH, then restart PowerShell
- **"MSVC not found"** → Install Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with "Desktop development with C++" workload
- **"Cannot find COM port"** → Check Device Manager for FTDI device

### Why Build Tools vs Full IDE?
- **Build Tools** (recommended for CI/servers): Minimal install, command-line only, faster
- **Full IDE**: If you want Visual Studio's editor, debugger, and GUI features
- Both work identically with CMake and the launch script!

### Folder Organization
- **`ucx-windows-app/bin/`** - Temporary build outputs (unsigned executables, auto-built, gitignored)
- **`ucx-windows-app/release/`** - Production releases (code-signed executable, tracked in git for distribution)
- **`build/`** - CMake build directory (intermediate files, project files, gitignored)
- **`ucxclient/`** - Git submodule containing the UCX client library and API

### Settings File Location Strategy
The `ucx-windows-app.ini` file uses smart location detection:

1. **Launcher usage** (recommended):
   - Launcher creates/uses `ucx-windows-app.ini` in project root
   - Shared settings across all executions
   - Easy to find and edit

2. **Direct exe usage** (standalone):
   - Application checks `../../ucx-windows-app.ini` (navigate from bin/release to root)
   - If found: Uses root settings (same as launcher)
   - If not found: Creates `ucx-windows-app.ini` next to exe (standalone mode)

**Settings include:**
- Last COM port and device model
- Wi-Fi profiles (SSID, password, IP prefix for auto-detection)
- Bluetooth device profiles (address, name)
- Remote server addresses
- Menu mode preference (detailed/compact)
- Logging and timestamp settings
- API keys (Combain location service)
- Regulatory domain preference

## Architecture

### Clean Design
```
ucx-windows-app.c (~25,000 lines)
├── Main application loop
├── Device management (connect/disconnect/auto-detect)
├── Menu system (detailed/compact modes, status dashboard)
├── Power & System (reboot, factory reset, power mgmt)
├── Bluetooth operations (scan, connect, bond, SPS, GATT)
├── Wi-Fi operations (scan, connect, AP mode, diagnostics, profiles)
├── Network services (Socket, HTTP, MQTT, TLS)
├── Example implementations (9 BT + 4 Wi-Fi examples)
├── Firmware update (XMODEM with SHA256 verification)
├── Settings management (load/save, Wi-Fi/BT profiles, encryption)
├── Connection tracking (symmetric for all types: BT, SPS, Socket, HTTP, MQTT)
└── Utility functions (logging, input validation, help, IP detection)
```

### Connection Tracking (Symmetric Design)
All connection types have consistent tracking:
- **Bluetooth**: Connect/disconnect URCs → `gBtConnections[]` array
- **SPS**: Connect/disconnect URCs → `gActiveSpsConnectionHandle`
- **Socket**: Connect/closed URCs → `gCurrentSocket`
- **HTTP**: Request status/disconnect URCs → `gHttpConnected` + `gHttpLastSessionId`
- **MQTT**: Connect/disconnect URCs → `gActiveMqttClientId`

Each type has:
- URC event flags for synchronization
- Pending data structures for data-available events
- Registration/unregistration in init/cleanup functions

### Direct API Integration
Native C code directly calls ucxclient API functions:
```c
// Initialize device
uPortAtInit(&gAtClient);
uPortAtOpen(&gAtClient, "COM31", 115200, false);
uCxInit(&gAtClient, &gUcxHandle);

// Execute commands
uCxGeneralGetDeviceInfo(&gUcxHandle, &info);
uCxBluetoothGetMode(&gUcxHandle, &btMode);
uCxWifiStationConnect(&gUcxHandle, ssid, passphrase);
uCxSocketCreate(&gUcxHandle, protocol, &socketHandle);
```

### Versioning System
- **Format**: `3.2.0.BUILD` where BUILD = YYDDD (year + day of year)
- **Alignment**: Major.Minor.Patch follows UCX API version
- **Auto-increment**: Build number updates daily based on current date
- **Display**: Shown in menu header and Windows file properties
- **Implementation**: CMake generates `version.h` from template at build time

## Advanced Features

### Wi-Fi Profile Management
Automatic network selection based on PC IP address:
- Saves up to 10 Wi-Fi profiles with SSID, password, and IP prefix
- Auto-detects current PC IP address (skips loopback and APIPA addresses)
- Matches IP prefix (first 3 octets) to suggest correct profile
- Example: PC IP `10.12.71.133` → matches profile with `ip_prefix=10.12.71`
- Always displays PC IP address when checking for matches
- Falls back to active profile if no IP match found

Profile structure:
```ini
wifi_profile_count=3
wifi_active_profile=0
wifi_profile_0_name=Office_Wi-Fi
wifi_profile_0_ssid=ubx
wifi_profile_0_password=32331c350e382840031e5c1c22573412  # Encrypted
wifi_profile_0_ip_prefix=10.12.71
wifi_profile_1_name=Home
wifi_profile_1_ssid=home_network
wifi_profile_1_password=012d1e0e16210c16  # Encrypted
wifi_profile_1_ip_prefix=192.168.1
```

### Bluetooth Device Profiles
Save frequently used Bluetooth devices:
- Stores device name and address
- Quick connect to saved devices
- Supports both Classic and BLE addresses
- Address format: `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` or `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,type`
